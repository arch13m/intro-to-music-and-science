# About this website

This website hosts a collection of draft lecture notes for Music and Science teaching at the [Centre for Music and Science](https://cms.mus.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge. I'm populating these incrementally as I work through these first few terms of teaching the new courses.
