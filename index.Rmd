# About this website

This website hosts a collection of draft lecture notes for Music and Science teaching at the [Centre for Music and Science](https://cms.mus.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge. I'm populating these incrementally as I work through these first few terms of teaching the new courses.

# About the Cambridge courses

There are currently two undergraduate music and science courses run at the Faculty of Music at the University of Cambridge: the Part IB (i.e. second-year) course 'Introduction to Music & Science', and the Part II (i.e. third-year) course 'Music Psychology in Practice'. The Part IB course is currently taught mostly by Peter Harrison, whereas the Part II course is taught in collaboration by Katie Rose Sanfilippo, Peter Harrison, Anna Wiedemann, and Huw Cheston.

As it stands for the present academic year (2021-22), the lecture materials provided here correspond specifically to the lectures in each course that are presented by Peter. This corresponds to 7/8 of the Part IB course (i.e. all except qualitative methods) and 3/8 of the Part II course (i.e. quantitative methods and computational cognitive science).

My motivation for writing these lecture notes is to give students a detailed and consolidated reference for the core topics covered in the topics. By having the material presented in this fashion, we can avoid relying on long lectures focused solely on content delivery. Instead, students are expected to spend time in advance of the lectures reading through the material, allowing us then to use the lecture periods to discuss the content in a much more interactive way.
