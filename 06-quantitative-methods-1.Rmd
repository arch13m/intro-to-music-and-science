## Identifying a research topic

Every scientist has their own motivations for working in a particular field

-   You find it interesting / you like working there

-   You think that the topic is understudied

-   You think the research would have important implications

    -   You think we would learn something important

    -   You think you will influence other researchers

    -   You think your work will have important applications

-   You are interested in the skillset that the work involves

    -   Make the most of existing skills

    -   Develop skills that you want to develop

How do you find the right topic?

-   Reading broadly

-   Attending talks/conferences

-   Thinking broadly (I wonder if someone has studied this?)

## Identifying a research question

-   Literature reviews

    -   Ad hoc review

    -   Systematic literature review
