<!-- #### Heart rate -->

<!-- Heart rate can be measured with inexpensive and unobtrusive heart rate monitors. Many smart watches nowadays even include heart rate monitors as standard. -->

<!-- #### Respiration rate -->

<!-- The respiration rate corresponds to the number of breaths that the participant takes per minute. One way of measuring this is with a 'pneumograph', as displayed here: a pneumograph measures respiration by tracking chest movements. -->

<!-- #### Skin conductance -->

<!-- #### Skin temperature -->

<!-- #### Facial electromyography -->

<!-- #### Pupillometry -->

<!-- Goosebumps -->

<!-- Intense emotional experiences, especially in the context of music, are often accompanied by skin tingling and goosebumps, corresponding to a process called 'piloerection' where body hairs stand on end. These experiences are called 'chills'. It's possible to record the development of goosebumps using custom cameras placed for example on the participant's arm. -->
