# Part 1

## Research proposals \[9:00\]

Introducing the idea of having to do a research proposal.

-   What is it?
-   Motivation
-   What kind of things is it testing?
-   What opportunities does it provide?

## Research topics \[9:10\]

Reminder: what's a research topic?

-   A body of literature

-   An associated collection of scientists

Interactive question: think of a research topic that interests you.
\[Give them some time to think carefully about this. Allow people to
make multiple responses if they want\].

Choose one or more topics to discuss \[just spoken, not digitally\].

-   Who suggested it?
-   Who thinks it's an interesting research topic? (raise hands)
-   Why do we think it's interesting?
-   What's its potential impact?
-   What kinds of resources and academic environment would be needed to
    study it?
-   How costly do we think the research is? (time, money, ethics)

## Research questions \[9:25\]

Reminder: what makes a good question?

-   The answer is unknown
-   The answer is likely to be impactful
-   The answer is practical to achieve

Interactive question: think back to one of the research topics you
mentioned previously. Try and think of a good research question within
that topic. Don't worry if you don't know the literature so well.

Read out a few of the research questions.

Interactive question: for a given one of those research questions
\[x3?\]...

-   Rate how unknown the answer is

-   Rate how impactful the answer would be

-   Rate how practical it would be to get that answer

## Quantitative vs qualitative \[9:40\]

Reminder: what is quantitative research?

Reminder: what is qualitative research?

Open question: What kinds of music research questions do you think are
better suited to quantitative research and which to qualitative
research? Why?

# Break \[10:05\]

# Part 2 \[10:10\]

## Variables \[10:10\]

Reminder: types of variables

-   Categorical variables

-   Ordinal variables

-   Continuous variables

    -   Interval variables: addition and subtraction are meaningful
        (e.g. time of day)

    -   Ratio variables: multiplication is a meaningful operation (e.g.
        weight, money)

Interactive question: categorise variables

-   Name

-   Age

-   'How beautiful is this sound?' on a scale from 1-7

Interactive question: think back to your research question. What kinds
of experimental variables can you imagine being relevant here? Enter a
few, put the variable type in brackets.

Reminder: Limitations, in particular reliability and validity

Interactive question x 3 (free-text): take an example variable presented
before and propose potential limitations

## Causality \[10:25\]

Reminders:

-   What does it mean for something to *cause* something else?

-   Why does correlation not equal causation?

-   The difference between prediction and explanation, and why causation
    is important for the latter

-   How do we establish causation? By conducting a manipulation.

-   Independent and dependent variables

    -   Independent: what we change

    -   Dependent: what we measure

Interactive question: what would the independent and dependent variables
be for an experiment addressing your research question? Write both the
research question and the variables.

## Generalisability \[10:45\]

Reminder: scientists often want to generalise from a sample group to a
population

-   Sampling people

-   Sampling music

Interactive question: what would the ideal sample group be for your
hypothetical experiment? What would a reasonable approximation be?
Include your research question in your response.
