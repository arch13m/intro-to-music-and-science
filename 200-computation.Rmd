## Cognitive science

### Introduction

Cognitive science is a research discipline occupied with understanding the mental underpinnings of intelligent behaviour, or, simply put, *how the mind works*. 
<!-- The traditional focus is on the human mind, but cognitive science can also include the study of animal intelligence and artificial intelligence. -->
It is best understood as a branch of psychology, but one that has strong connections with related fields including neuroscience, artificial intelligence, linguistics, anthropology, and philosophy [@Miller2003-ku].

What differentiates cognitive science from the rest of psychology is its belief that the mind is best understood as an *information-processing system*. This system is modelled in terms of two fundamental components: (a) a set of *mental representations* used for storing information, and (b) a set of *mental operations* that can be applied to these representations [@Thagard2019-vo].

What is a *mental representation*? A mental representation is some kind of mental abstraction that stands for some kind of semantic concept. Mental representations are closely tied to the idea of 'meaning'; in fact, they *are* the way in which meaning is represented in the mind. For example, suppose I ask you to think of a dog. This request might elicit a variety of representations; one representation might be visual, corresponding to a mental image of a familiar dog from childhood; another might be auditory, corresponding to the sound of a dog barking; another might be emotional, reflecting your personal fondness of dogs.

What is a *mental operation*? A mental operation is some kind of procedure that can be performed on one or more mental representations. For example, a visual representation might afford rotation or scaling operations. A numeric representation might instead afford arithmetic manipulations such as addition and subtraction.

<!-- The discipline is inherently multidisciplinary, being historically envisioned as intersecting with psychology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, linguistics, anthropology, and philosophy [@Miller2003-ku].  -->
<!-- Practically speaking, though, cognitive science  -->

<!-- mainly manifests as a technically oriented brand of psychology. -->

<!-- The fundamental tenet of cognitive science is that the mind can be understood as a system for processing information. This system is modelled in terms of two fundamental components: (a) a set of *mental representations* used for storing information, and (b) a set of *computational operations* that can be applied to these representations [@Thagard2019-vo].  -->

### Cognitive models

The basic research paradigm of cognitive science works as follows. We identify a certain *task* that someone might perform, for example catching a ball or solving a crossword puzzle. We then develop a *cognitive model* of the process required for solving this task, comprising a sequence of mental representations and operations that together explain how the human performs the task. This cognitive model is to be tested and validated through experimentation with human participants.

<!-- A given *cognitive model* then summarises the mental representations and computational operations involved in carrying out a particular task. -->

For example, suppose we wish to develop a cognitive model for how humans recognise melodies. We would start with the information present in the auditory nerve, which is rich and complex, containing lots of spectral and temporal information. Our cognitive model would begin by describing how the brain converts this information into a *pitch* representation, perhaps using a harmonic template-matching analysis. In the next step, the model might then describe how the brain infers the melody's *key*; this might be achieved by analysing pitch-class distributions and comparing them to prototypical distributions for different keys, as suggested by Carol Krumhansl [@krumhansl1990cognitive]. The model could then use this derived key to represent the melody as a sequence of scale degrees. The resulting sequence of scale degrees can then be compared to sequences memorised through past music listening experiences; if a sufficiently close match is found, this would trigger 'recognition'.

### Cognition and computation

Cognitive models are well-suited to implementation as computer programs. They are formulated in terms of information processing, and information processing is what computers are built for. Moreover, the principles of mental representations and mental operations map very naturally to analogous software principles of data structures and functions.

Many cognitive scientists regularly implement their cognitive models as computer programs. There are several reasons why this can be useful. 

-   Coding -> hypothesis generation
-   Precise statements about the theory
-   Testable predictions (that can be generated fast)
-   Applications in AI

### Levels of explanation

Models are by definition *simplified* accounts of the world. They take a complex phenomenon -- for example emotion recognition -- and try to approximate it using a small number of components. We accept that the model may not be true in an *absolute* sense, but we hope that it will nonetheless help us to understand the world better. This idea is captured in a famous aphorism by the statistician George Box (1919--2013):

> All models are wrong, but some are useful.

Cognitive models are clearly simplified accounts of human intelligence. 

In cognitive science it is possible to build cognitive models at different *levels of explanation*. 

~~~

A fundamental principle in cognitive science is the idea that a given cognitive phenomenon may have *multiple levels of explanation*.
For example, on one level, we know that the brain represents information in terms of temporal patterns of neural firings that are highly distributed around the cerebral cortex. This might be called the *neuroscientific* level of explanation. However, we might also know that the brain's short-term memory behaves *as if* it were a finite-capacity store with approximately seven slots, each of which can store a single *chunk* of information [@Miller1956-hy]. We might call this the *cognitive* level of explanation. Both levels of explanation can be useful in different contexts. The neuroscientific level might be useful when trying to understand the impact of various brain lesions on cognitive function; the cognitive level might be useful when trying to predict a participant's success on different working memory tasks. A famous articulation of this concept of multiple levels of explanation has been given by David Marr [@Marr1982-di].

 <!-- This principle has been given its most famous exposition by the vision scientist David Marr [@Marr1982-di]. Marr distinguished three levels in particular: -->

The term *cognitive model* is typically used to describe a formalised cognitive account of a particular process. The word 'model' is there to emphasise the fact that the model is a simplification of reality. The human brain is immensely complex -- thought to contain over 100 billion neurons [@Herculano-Houzel2009-mu] -- and a given cognitive model will only reach a tiny fraction of this complexity. In the context of modelling, however, simplicity is a virtue; the simpler a model, the easier it is to reason about.


The reductionist answer to these questions clearly lies in neuroscience. Information is *represented* in terms of patterns of neural firings distributed through the brain; we know from prior neuroscientific research that the precise nature of these firings varies from individual to individual, and depends on past experiences which continually shape the brain and the way in which its neurons connect to one another. Information is also *manipulated* through neural processes; a particularly important mechanism seems to be the way in which individual neurons integrate incoming information from multiple neurons at their dendrites, and decide on this basis whether to fire themselves or not.

The difficulty with studying information on the neuroscientific basis is the enormous complexity of the underlying representation. The human brain is thought to contain over 100 billion neurons [@Herculano-Houzel2009-mu], which could theoretically fire in any combination. Decoding the meaning of these firing combinations would be an immensely challenging task, even if we could measure them all simultaneously, which is not yet possible with noninvasive techniques.

Cognitive science responds to this issue by claiming that the mind can usefully be approximated, or *modelled*, by a much simpler system that is relatively independent of the underlying biology. For example, suppose we ask the question "How does the mind represent a melody?". The neuroscientist's answer to this question would be in terms of neural firings; while they might not be able to tell you exactly what neurons map to what melodies, they might well be able to tell you approximately where these neurons are located in the brain. In contrast, the cognitive scientist would likely respond in terms of cognitive constructs such as 'scale degrees' and 'rhythmic categories': "the listener hears *do* followed by *so* and then *fa* in an anapaest rhythm".

Both neuroscientific and cognitive approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. The neuroscientific interpretation is clearly closer to the 'true' answer, in a certain sense. Neurons and neural firing patterns are 'real', or at least tangible, in a way that mental representations of scale degrees are not. On the other hand, the dynamics of these processes are so complex that it's hard to know how we could ever come up with a complete yet understandable neuroscientific model of a high-level mental process such as aesthetics. In contrast, cognitive models are expressly designed for the purpose of interpretability. By stripping away details of the biological implementation, the hope is that we can capture the essence of a particular mental process in an interpretable yet predictively powerful way.

### Strategies for deriving cognitive models

-   Write down our guess of the solution based on intuition
-   Derive our model piece-by-piece from empirical evidence.
-   Rational observer - write down our knowledge of the problem, derive the optimal solution either mathematically or with machine-learning
-   Learning by imitation (machine-learning)
