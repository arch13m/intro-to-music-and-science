## Air and sound waves

Air is a mixture of gases, comprising many tiny particles that move around at great speed, constantly bouncing off nearby objects and other gas particles:

An important property of air is its *pressure*. Air pressure is defined as the force that the air exerts on the objects that it touches, normalised by its contact area. On an average day, the air pressure at sea level is about 101,000 Newtons per square metre; this means that every square metre of surface is receiving 101,000 Newtons of force, the equivalent of about five elephants.

We see air pressure changing over time scales of hours and days due to changing atmospheric conditions. Generally speaking, low pressure is associated with clouds, wind, and rain, whereas high pressure is associated with fairer and calmer weather.

Sound, meanwhile, corresponds to variation in air pressure over much shorter time periods. These are the kinds of vibrations produced when a bow moves along a violin string, when air resonates in a flute, or when a mallet hits a drum.

The simplest form of sound is the *pure tone*. A pure tone corresponds to a very special mathematical object, the sine wave. Here's what a sine wave looks like:

![Waveform for a pure tone (200 Hz).](images/sine-wave-pure-tone.png){width="522"}\

The graph shows pressure changing as a function of time. We see how pressure has a very regular, or *periodic* motion: its shape repeats exactly at regular intervals. Note that we've had to zoom into very small time intervals to see this repetitive structure: here the horizontal axis corresponds to just 0.03 seconds. Note also that, for convenience, we plot relative pressure, normalised such that zero corresponds to the baseline atmospheric pressure.

This is what the sine wave sounds like. The sound is considered very 'pure', as it only contains one sinusoidal component.

Like all sound waves, the pure tone travels through space. It takes the form of bands of alternating high and low pressure that move swiftly away from the sound source. In normal atmospheric conditions, the speed of the sound wave is approximately 343 metres per second.

The animation below illustrates what the sine wave looks like once we visualise the air as a collection of (normally invisible) gas particles. A high-pressure region (corresponding to a peak in the sine wave) is a region with a high density of air particles. We call such regions *compressions*. You can see these regions as vertical bands that move from left to right. In between the high-pressure regions we have low-pressure regions, which we call *rarefactions*.

Sine waves are defined by three parameters: *amplitude*, *frequency*, and *phase*. Let's consider each in turn.

The *amplitude* corresponds to the degree of pressure fluctuation in the sine wave. It is measured as the distance between the baseline and the extrema (i.e. the outer edges) of the wave. In the following figure the amplitude is 1.0 (in relative units):

![**A sine wave with an amplitude of 1.0.**](images/sine-wave-amplitude=1.png){width="500"}

If we decrease the amplitude to 0.5, the tone sounds quieter than it did before:

![**A sine wave with an amplitude of 0.5.**](images/sine-wave-amplitude=0.5.png){width="500"}

The frequency parameter determines how many complete wave cycles fit within one second. Frequency has the units 'Hz', so 30 cycles per second is written as 30 Hz, 40 cycles cycles per second is written as 40 Hz, and so on. Note that a complete cycle includes both the 'upper' segment and the 'lower segment' of the curve. For visualisation purposes, I've plotted a 5 Hz wave here, so we can see the number of cycles in a second; in practice, this frequency is below the range of human hearing:

![**A sine wave with a frequency of 5 Hz.**](images/sine-wave-frequency=5.png){width="500"}

We can hear a 120 Hz wave, though:

![**A sine wave with a frequency of 120 Hz.**](images/sine-wave-frequency=120.png){width="500"}

If we double the frequency, it sounds an octave higher:

![**A sine wave with a frequency of 240 Hz.**](images/sine-wave-frequency=240.png){width="500"}

If we multiply the frequency by another 1.5, it sounds an additional perfect fifth higher:

![**A sine wave with a frequency of 360 Hz.**](images/sine-wave-frequency=360.png){width="500"}

Later in this course we will discuss the relationship between frequency and pitch in more detail.

Lastly, the phase determines the starting point of the wave cycle. It takes values between zero and 2π, where π is a special mathematical constant with a value of approximately 3.14. A phase of zero means that the wave starts at the baseline, and immediately starts increasing in value, like all the previous examples:

![**A sine wave with a phase of 0.**](images/sine-wave-phase=0.png){width="500"}

Since 2π corresponds to a full cycle, a phase of 0.5π corresponds to a displacement of a quarter of a cycle.

![**A sine wave with a phase of 0.5π.**](images/sine-wave-phase=pi-by-2.png){width="500"}

By the same logic, a phase of 1.5π corresponds to a displacement of three quarters of a cycle.

![**A sine wave with a phase of 1.5π.**](images/sine-wave-phase=3-pi-by-2.png){width="500"}

Unlike frequency and amplitude, the effects of waveform phase on perception are subtle. We're not going to worry about them for now.

Now we are going to introduce the first of two important mathematical formulae. The first formula provides the formal definition of the sine wave. It takes the following form:

$$
x(t)=A\sin\left(2 \pi f t + \phi \right)
$$

where:

-   $x(t)$ is the relative pressure at time $t$;
-   $A$ is the amplitude;
-   $\sin$ is a special mathematical function that you can find on a calculator, which takes a single number as an input and returns a number between -1 and 1;
-   $\pi$ is a constant approximately equal to 3.14;
-   $f$ is the frequency in Hz;
-   $\phi$ is the phase, taking values between $0$ and $2\pi$.

So, if you know the frequency, phase, and amplitude, then you can calculate the relative pressure *at any point in time* by plugging the values into the formula.

Because sound takes time to travel, the sound wave moves a certain distance in the time that the sound source takes to emit one complete cycle. This distance is called the wavelength. If we could take a snapshot of a sound wave travelling through the air, you would see this wavelength as the distance between the peaks of the sound wave.

Our second formula tells us how to compute this wavelength. It takes the following form:

$$
\lambda = \frac{v}{f}
$$

where:

-   $\lambda$ is the wavelength (in metres);
-   $v$ is the speed of the wave (in metres per second);
-   $f$ is the frequency (in Hz).

If the wave is a sound wave, and we are assuming standard atmospheric conditions, then $v$ corresponds to the speed of sound, approximately 343 metres per second. If we are talking about a medium other than air, for example a string on a violin, then the speed of the wave will be different.

This formula allows us to calculate the wavelength for a sound of a given frequency. For example:

|                                                  | Frequency | Wavelength |
|--------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------|
| Concert A                                        | 440 Hz    | 78 cm      |
| Mozart's Queen of the Night aria, top F (F6)     | 1397 Hz   | 24.6 cm    |
| Rachmaninov All-Night Vigil, bottom B flat (B♭1) | 58.3 Hz   | 5.88 m     |

So far we have just discussed the sine wave, which is just a particular kind of wave. We can imagine many other kinds of waves, for example the sawtooth wave and the square wave. All of these waves have different sounds.

Here's a sawtooth wave, which has very sharp corners:

Here's a square wave, which has rectangular corners:
