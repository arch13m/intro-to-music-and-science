This repository hosts a collection of draft lecture notes for Music and Science teaching at the Centre for Music and Science at the University of Cambridge. I'm populating these incrementally as I work through these first few terms of teaching music and science courses. You can access the full website [here](https://pmcharrison.github.io/intro-to-music-and-science/).
