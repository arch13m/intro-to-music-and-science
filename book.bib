  abstract  = "What is it that drives people to undertake music research? Such
               interest frequently grows from on-the-ground experiences as
               learners, performers, facilitators, composers, arts
               administrators, and educators. It can emerge, for example, from
               music teachers trying out new teaching methods, performers
               wishing to know more about how to improvise effectively,
               educators pursuing the most effective ways to structure music
               curricula, musicians aiming to explain why their music enhances
               wellbeing among different groups of people, and orchestral
               managers seeking to promote and protect the health of their
               players. At the heart of all of these enquiries lies a question
               of some sort, and it is these research questions that determine
               the direction of the research to be undertaken. Performing Music
               Research is a comprehensive guide to planning, conducting,
               analyzing, and communicating research in music performance. The
               book examines the approaches and strategies that underpin
               research in music education, psychology, and performance
               science. It reviews the knowledge and skills needed to critique
               existing studies in these fields and to design and carry out new
               investigations. Perspectives on qualitative, quantitative, and
               multistrategy methodologies are highlighted across the book in
               ways that help aspiring researchers bring precision to their
               research questions, select methods that are appropriate for
               addressing their questions, and apply those methods
               systematically and rigorously. Each chapter contains a study
               guide, comprising a chapter summary, a list of keywords, and
               suggestions for further discussion, and the book concludes with
               a resources section, including a glossary and supplementary
               material to support advanced statistical analysis. The book''s
               companion website provides information designed to facilitate
               access to original research and to test knowledge and

  abstract  = "In melodies from a wide variety of cultures, a large pitch
               interval tends to be followed by a change of direction. Although
               this tendency is often attributed to listeners' expectations, it
               might arise more simply from constraints on melodic ranginess or
               tessitura. Skips tend toward the extremes of a melody's
               tessitura, and from those extremes a melody has little choice
               but to retreat by changing direction. Statistical analyses of
               vocal melodies from four different continents are consistent
               with this simple explanation. The results suggest that, in the
               sampled repertoires, patterns such as ``gap-fill,'' ``registral
               direction,'' and ``registral return'' (L. Meyer, 1956, 1973; E.

              explicated using experimentally established perceptual

              majority of voice-leading rules given in historical and
              contemporary music theory tracts. These principles are treated in
              a manner akin to axioms in a formal system from which the
              traditional rules of voice-leading are derived. Nontraditional
              rules aris- ing from the derivation are shown to predict formerly
              unnoticed aspects of voice-leading practice. In addition to the
              core perceptual principles, several auxiliary principles are
              described. These auxiliary principles are occasionally linked to
              voice-leading practice and may be regarded as com- positional
              ``options'' that shape the music-making in perceptually unique
              ways. It is suggested that these auxiliary principles distinguish
              different types of part writing, such as polyphony, homophony,
              and close har- mony. A theory is proposed to account for the
              aesthetic origin of voice- leading practices.",

  author   = "Harrison, P M C and Pearce, Marcus T",
  abstract = "Simultaneous consonance is a salient perceptual phenomenon
              corresponding to the perceived pleasantness of simultaneously
              sounding musical tones. Various competing theories of consonance
              have been proposed over the centuries, but recently a consensus
              has developed that simultaneous consonance is primarily driven by
              harmonicity perception. Here we question this view,
              substantiating our argument by critically reviewing historic
              consonance research from a broad variety of disciplines,
              reanalyzing consonance perception data from 4 previous behavioral
              studies representing more than 500 participants, and modeling
              three Western musical corpora representing more than 100,000
              compositions. We conclude that simultaneous consonance is a
              composite phenomenon that derives in large part from three
              phenomena: interference, periodicity/harmonicity, and cultural
              familiarity. We formalize this conclusion with a computational
              model that predicts a musical chord's simultaneous consonance
              from these three features, and release this model in an
              open-source R package, incon, alongside 15 other computational
              models also evaluated in this paper. We hope that this package
              will facilitate further psychological and musicological research
              into simultaneous consonance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020

  abstract  = "The high-frequency limit of phase-locking has been measured in
               fibres of the auditory nerve in the guinea-pig. It is shown that
               phase-locking begins to decline at about 600 Hz and is no longer
               detectable above 3.5 kHz which is about 1 octave lower than in
               the cat, squirrel monkey and some birds. Direct measurements of
               the cochlear afferent fibre synaptic delay are consistent with
               indirect estimates from phase-locking, both giving values of
               0.7-0.8 ms. Measurements of the receptor potentials of inner
               hair-cells in the guinea pig cochlea indicate that as the
               stimulus frequency is increased there is a progressive decrease
               in the a.c. component compared to the steady depolarization. The
               cause of this decline is the low-pass filtering of the a.c.
               component by the hair-cell membrane. The cut-off and slope of
               the decline in the a.c. component is consistent with the
               suggestion that this process is the limiting factor in cochlear
               nerve fibre phase-locking. The implications of these findings

               the academic performance of music and non-music students from
               seventh to ninth grade. The study controls for socioeconomic
               status, intelligence, motivation and prior academic achievement.
               Data were collected from 110 adolescents at two time points,
               once when the students were between 11 and 14 years old in the
               seventh grade, and again 3 years later. Our results show that
               music students perform better academically than non-music
               students in the seventh grade (Cohen's d = 0.88) and in the
               ninth grade (Cohen's d = 1.05). This difference is particularly
               evident in their scores in Portuguese language and natural
               science; the difference is somewhat weaker in history and
               geography scores, and is least pronounced in mathematics and
               English scores ( $\eta$2 p from .09 to .21). A longitudinal

               $\eta$2 p = .07). Furthermore, controlling for intelligence,
               socioeconomic status and motivation did not eliminate the

               the ninth grade and students' academic achievement ( $\eta$2 p =
               .06). During the period, music students maintained better and

  abstract = "Training programs aimed to alleviate or improve
              auditory-cognitive abilities have either experienced mixed
              success or remain to be fully validated. The limited benefits of
              such regimens are largely attributable to our weak understanding
              of (i) how (and which) interventions provide the most robust and
              long lasting improvements to cognitive and perceptual abilities
              and (ii) how the neural mechanisms which underlie such abilities
              are positively modified by certain activities and experience.
              Recent studies indicate that music training provides robust,
              long-lasting biological benefits to auditory function.
              Importantly, the behavioral advantages conferred by musical
              experience extend beyond simple enhancements to perceptual
              abilities and even impact non-auditory functions necessary for
              higher-order aspects of cognition (e.g., working memory,
              intelligence). Collectively, preliminary findings indicate that
              alternative forms of arts engagement (e.g., visual arts training)
              may not yield such widespread enhancements, suggesting that music
              expertise uniquely taps and refines a hierarchy of brain networks
              subserving a variety of auditory as well as domain-general
              cognitive mechanisms. We infer that transfer from specific music
              experience to broad cognitive benefit might be mediated by the
              degree to which a listener's musical training tunes lower- (e.g.,
              perceptual) and higher-order executive functions, and the
              coordination between these processes. Ultimately, understanding
              the broad impact of music on the brain will not only provide a
              more holistic picture of auditory processing and plasticity, but
              may help inform and tailor remediation and training programs
              designed to improve perceptual and cognitive benefits in human
              listeners.",

               book describes the state of the art in error-correcting codes,
               including low-density parity-check codes, turbo codes, and
               digital fountain codes -- the twenty-first century standards for
               satellite communications, disk drives, and data broadcast.
               Richly illustrated, filled with worked examples and over 400
               exercises, some with detailed solutions, David MacKay's
               groundbreaking book is ideal for self-learning and for
               undergraduate or graduate courses. Interludes on crosswords,
               evolution, and sex provide entertainment along the way. In sum,
               this is a textbook on information, communication, and coding for
               a new generation of students, and an unparalleled entry point
               into these subjects for professionals in areas as diverse as
               computational biology, financial engineering, and machine

              populations that we sample. However, most research published in

               that college students who listened to the first 10 minutes of a
               Mozart sonata (K.448) scored higher on a spatial-temporal
               reasoning task immediately afterward---an effect that lasted
               approximately 10 minutes. This chapter presents the school
               district of Kettle-Moraine study. Children from four
               kindergarten classrooms at two Wisconsin public elementary
               schools in the school district of Kettle-Moraine participated.
               Some children received piano keyboard instruction (keyboard
               group) and others received no special training (no music group).
               The study began by pretesting all the children using two
               spatial-temporal tasks, a puzzle-solving task, a block-building
               task, and one pictorial memory task. Children were posttested
               twice, once following 4 months of lessons and a second time
               following 8 months. Results showed that young children who were
               provided with music instruction scored higher on
               spatial-temporal tasks compared with children who did not
               receive the instruction. The effect was significant after 4
               months of instruction. No enhancement was found for a nonspatial
               task: pictorial memory. However, when the music instruction was
               terminated the children's scores began to decrease. The children
               who received instruction over the entire 4 years of the study
               continued to score higher on the spatial-temporal tasks. The
               effects of music instruction on spatial-temporal abilities may
               be explained by two types of theories. Neuroscientific theories
               assert that music instruction induces physiological changes in
               brain structure that consequently affect spatial-temporal
               processing. Transfer theories, on the other hand, suggest that
               playing a musical instrument and performing a spatial-temporal
               task require similar cognitive skills, and thus the skills
               involved in making music may transfer to spatial-temporal task
               performance.",

              processes that continuously modify the human brain and may
              facilitate characteristic auditory skills. In a longitudinal
              study, we investigated the auditory and neural plasticity of
              musical learning in 111 young children (aged 7-9 y) as a function
              of the intensity of instrumental practice and musical aptitude.
              Because of the frequent co-occurrence of central auditory
              processing disorders and attentional deficits, we also tested 21
              children with attention deficit (hyperactivity) disorder
              [AD(H)D]. Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography
              revealed enlarged Heschl's gyri and enhanced right-left
              hemispheric synchronization of the primary evoked response (P1)
              to harmonic complex sounds in children who spent more time
              practicing a musical instrument. The anatomical characteristics
              were positively correlated with frequency discrimination,
              reading, and spelling skills. Conversely, AD(H)D children showed
              reduced volumes of Heschl's gyri and enhanced volumes of the
              plana temporalia that were associated with a distinct bilateral
              P1 asynchrony. This may indicate a risk for central auditory
              processing disorders that are often associated with attentional
              and literacy problems. The longitudinal comparisons revealed a
              very high stability of auditory cortex morphology and gray matter
              volumes, suggesting that the combined anatomical and functional

  author   = "Sala, Giovanni and Gobet, Fernand",
  abstract = "Music training has repeatedly been claimed to positively impact
              children's cognitive skills and academic achievement (literacy
              and mathematics). This claim relies on the assumption that
              engaging in intellectually demanding activities fosters
              particular domain-general cognitive skills, or even general
              intelligence. The present meta-analytic review (N = 6,984, k =
              254, m = 54) shows that this belief is incorrect. Once the
              quality of study design is controlled for, the overall effect of
              music training programs is null ([Formula: see text] $\approx$ 0)
              and highly consistent across studies ($\tau$2 $\approx$ 0).
              Results of Bayesian analyses employing distributional assumptions
              (informative priors) derived from previous research in cognitive
              training corroborate these conclusions. Small statistically
              significant overall effects are obtained only in those studies
              implementing no random allocation of participants and employing
              non-active controls ([Formula: see text] $\approx$ 0.200, p <
              .001). Interestingly, music training is ineffective regardless of
              the type of outcome measure (e.g., verbal, non-verbal,
              speed-related, etc.), participants' age, and duration of
              training. Furthermore, we note that, beyond meta-analysis of
              experimental studies, a considerable amount of cross-sectional
              evidence indicates that engagement in music has no impact on
              people's non-music cognitive skills or academic achievement. We
              conclude that researchers' optimism about the benefits of music
              training is empirically unjustified and stems from
              misinterpretation of the empirical data and, possibly,
              confirmation bias.",

  author    = "Deutsch, Diana",
  abstract  = "The Psychology of Music draws together the diverse and scattered
               literature on the psychology of music. It explores the way music
               is processed by the listener and the performer and considers
               several issues that are of importance both to perceptual
               psychology and to contemporary music, such as the way the sound
               of an instrument is identified regardless of its pitch or
               loudness, or the types of information that can be discarded in
               the synthetic replication of a sound without distorting
               perceived timbre. Comprised of 18 chapters, this book begins
               with a review of the classical psychoacoustical literature on
               tone perception, focusing on characteristics of particular
               relevance to music. The attributes of pitch, loudness, and
               timbre are examined, and a summary of research methods in
               psychoacoustics is presented. Subsequent chapters deal with
               timbre perception; the subjective effects of different sound
               fields; temporal aspects of music; abstract structures formed by
               pitch relationships in music; different tests of musical
               ability; and the importance of abstract structural
               representation in understanding how music is performed. The
               final chapter evaluates the relationship between new music and
               psychology. This monograph should be a valuable resource for
               psychologists and musicians.",

@ARTICLE{Temperley2008-tj,
  title    = "A probabilistic model of melody perception",
  author   = "Temperley, David",
  abstract = "This study presents a probabilistic model of melody perception,
              which infers the key of a melody and also judges the probability
              of the melody itself. The model uses Bayesian reasoning: For any
              ``surface'' pattern and underlying ``structure,'' we can infer
              the structure maximizing P(structure|surface) based on knowledge
              of P(surface, structure). The probability of the surface can then
              be calculated as $\sum$ P(surface, structure), summed over all
              structures. In this case, the surface is a pattern of notes; the
              structure is a key. A generative model is proposed, based on
              three principles: (a) melodies tend to remain within a narrow
              pitch range; (b) note-to-note intervals within a melody tend to
              be small; and (c) notes tend to conform to a distribution (or key
              profile) that depends on the key. The model is tested in three
              ways. First, it is tested on its ability to identify the keys of
              a set of folksong melodies. Second, it is tested on a melodic
              expectation task in which it must judge the probability of
              different notes occurring given a prior context; these judgments
              are compared with perception data from a melodic expectation
              experiment. Finally, the model is tested on its ability to detect
              incorrect notes in melodies by assigning them lower probabilities
              than the original versions.",

  title    = "The construction and evaluation of statistical models of melodic
              structure in music perception and composition",
  author   = "Pearce, Marcus T",
  abstract = "The prevalent approach to developing cognitive models of music
              perception and composition is to construct systems of symbolic
              rules and constraints on the basis of extensive music-theoretic
              and music-analytic knowledge. The the- sis proposed in this
              dissertation is that statistical models which acquire knowl- edge
              through the induction of regularities in corpora of existing
              music can, if examined with appropriate methodologies, provide
              significant insights into the cognitive processing involved in
              music perception and composition. This claim is examined in three
              stages. First, a number of statistical modelling techniques drawn
              from the fields of data compression, statistical language
              modelling and machine learning are subjected to empirical
              evaluation in the context of se- quential prediction of pitch
              structure in unseen melodies. This investigation results in a
              collection of modelling strategies which together yield
              significant performance improvements over existing methods. In
              the second stage, these statistical systems are used to examine
              observed patterns of expectation col- lected in previous
              psychological research on melody perception. In contrast to
              previous accounts of this data, the results demonstrate that
              these patterns of expectation can be accounted for in terms of
              the induction of statistical regu- larities acquired through
              exposure to music. In the final stage of the present research,
              the statistical systems developed in the first stage are used to
              examine the intrinsic computational demands of the task of
              composing a stylistically suc- cessful melody. The results
              suggest that the systems lack the degree of expres- sive power
              needed to consistently meet the demands of the task. In contrast
              to previous research, however, the methodological framework
              developed for the evaluation of computationalmodels of
              composition enables a detailed empirical examination and
              comparison of suchmodels which facilitates the identification and
              resolution of their weaknesses.",

               review of the latest developments in this fast-growing area of
               research. Covering both experimental and theoretical
               perspectives, each of the 11 sections is edited byan
               internationally recognised authority in the area. The first ten
               parts present chapters that focus on specific areas of music
               psychology: the origins and functions of music; music
               perception, responses to music; music and the brain; musical
               development; learning musical skills; musical performance;
               composition and improvisation; the role of music ineveryday
               life; and music therapy. In each part authors critically review
               the literature, highlight current issues and explore
               possibilities for the future. The final part examines how, in
               recent years, the study of music psychology has broadened to
               include a range of other disciplines. It considers the way that
               research has developed in relation to technological advances,

  abstract = "Simultaneous consonance is a salient perceptual phenomenon
              corresponding to the perceived pleasantness of simultaneously
              sounding musical tones. Various competing theories of consonance
              have been proposed over the centuries, but recently a consensus
              has developed that simultaneous consonance is primarily driven by
              harmonicity perception. Here we question this view,
              substantiating our argument by critically reviewing historic
              consonance research from a broad variety of disciplines,
              reanalyzing consonance perception data from 4 previous behavioral
              studies representing more than 500 participants, and modeling
              three Western musical corpora representing more than 100,000
              compositions. We conclude that simultaneous consonance is a
              composite phenomenon that derives in large part from three
              phenomena: interference, periodicity/harmonicity, and cultural
              familiarity. We formalize this conclusion with a computational
              model that predicts a musical chord's simultaneous consonance
              from these three features, and release this model in an
              open-source R package, incon, alongside 15 other computational
              models also evaluated in this paper. We hope that this package
              will facilitate further psychological and musicological research

              using an extremely brief measure of the Big-Five personality
              dimensions or using no measure at all. To meet the need for a
              very brief measure, 5 and 10-item inventories were developed and
              evaluated. Although somewhat inferior to standard multi-item
              instruments, the instruments reached adequate levels in terms of:
              (a) convergence with widely used Big-Five measures in self,
              observer, and peer reports, (b) test-retest reliability, (c)
              patterns of predicted external correlates, and (d) convergence
