  abstract  = "What is it that drives people to undertake music research? Such
               interest frequently grows from on-the-ground experiences as
               learners, performers, facilitators, composers, arts
               administrators, and educators. It can emerge, for example, from
               music teachers trying out new teaching methods, performers
               wishing to know more about how to improvise effectively,
               educators pursuing the most effective ways to structure music
               curricula, musicians aiming to explain why their music enhances
               wellbeing among different groups of people, and orchestral
               managers seeking to promote and protect the health of their
               players. At the heart of all of these enquiries lies a question
               of some sort, and it is these research questions that determine
               the direction of the research to be undertaken. Performing Music
               Research is a comprehensive guide to planning, conducting,
               analyzing, and communicating research in music performance. The
               book examines the approaches and strategies that underpin
               research in music education, psychology, and performance
               science. It reviews the knowledge and skills needed to critique
               existing studies in these fields and to design and carry out new
               investigations. Perspectives on qualitative, quantitative, and
               multistrategy methodologies are highlighted across the book in
               ways that help aspiring researchers bring precision to their
               research questions, select methods that are appropriate for
               addressing their questions, and apply those methods
               systematically and rigorously. Each chapter contains a study
               guide, comprising a chapter summary, a list of keywords, and
               suggestions for further discussion, and the book concludes with
               a resources section, including a glossary and supplementary
               material to support advanced statistical analysis. The book''s
               companion website provides information designed to facilitate
               access to original research and to test knowledge and
               understanding.",
