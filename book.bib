  abstract  = "What is it that drives people to undertake music research? Such
               interest frequently grows from on-the-ground experiences as
               learners, performers, facilitators, composers, arts
               administrators, and educators. It can emerge, for example, from
               music teachers trying out new teaching methods, performers
               wishing to know more about how to improvise effectively,
               educators pursuing the most effective ways to structure music
               curricula, musicians aiming to explain why their music enhances
               wellbeing among different groups of people, and orchestral
               managers seeking to promote and protect the health of their
               players. At the heart of all of these enquiries lies a question
               of some sort, and it is these research questions that determine
               the direction of the research to be undertaken. Performing Music
               Research is a comprehensive guide to planning, conducting,
               analyzing, and communicating research in music performance. The
               book examines the approaches and strategies that underpin
               research in music education, psychology, and performance
               science. It reviews the knowledge and skills needed to critique
               existing studies in these fields and to design and carry out new
               investigations. Perspectives on qualitative, quantitative, and
               multistrategy methodologies are highlighted across the book in
               ways that help aspiring researchers bring precision to their
               research questions, select methods that are appropriate for
               addressing their questions, and apply those methods
               systematically and rigorously. Each chapter contains a study
               guide, comprising a chapter summary, a list of keywords, and
               suggestions for further discussion, and the book concludes with
               a resources section, including a glossary and supplementary
               material to support advanced statistical analysis. The book''s
               companion website provides information designed to facilitate
               access to original research and to test knowledge and

               personality and the culture in which we were raised? Why do
               certain songs remind us so strongly of particular people,

  author    = "Deutsch, Diana",
  abstract  = "The Psychology of Music draws together the diverse and scattered
               literature on the psychology of music. It explores the way music
               is processed by the listener and the performer and considers
               several issues that are of importance both to perceptual
               psychology and to contemporary music, such as the way the sound
               of an instrument is identified regardless of its pitch or
               loudness, or the types of information that can be discarded in
               the synthetic replication of a sound without distorting
               perceived timbre. Comprised of 18 chapters, this book begins
               with a review of the classical psychoacoustical literature on
               tone perception, focusing on characteristics of particular
               relevance to music. The attributes of pitch, loudness, and
               timbre are examined, and a summary of research methods in
               psychoacoustics is presented. Subsequent chapters deal with
               timbre perception; the subjective effects of different sound
               fields; temporal aspects of music; abstract structures formed by
               pitch relationships in music; different tests of musical
               ability; and the importance of abstract structural
               representation in understanding how music is performed. The
               final chapter evaluates the relationship between new music and
               psychology. This monograph should be a valuable resource for
               psychologists and musicians.",

               updates the original landmark text and provides a comprehensive
               review of the latest developments in this fast-growing area of
               research. Covering both experimental and theoretical
               perspectives, each of the 11 sections is edited byan
               internationally recognised authority in the area. The first ten
               parts present chapters that focus on specific areas of music
               psychology: the origins and functions of music; music
               perception, responses to music; music and the brain; musical
               development; learning musical skills; musical performance;
               composition and improvisation; the role of music ineveryday
               life; and music therapy. In each part authors critically review
               the literature, highlight current issues and explore
               possibilities for the future. The final part examines how, in
               recent years, the study of music psychology has broadened to
               include a range of other disciplines. It considers the way that
               research has developed in relation to technological advances,

  abstract = "Simultaneous consonance is a salient perceptual phenomenon
              corresponding to the perceived pleasantness of simultaneously
              sounding musical tones. Various competing theories of consonance
              have been proposed over the centuries, but recently a consensus
              has developed that simultaneous consonance is primarily driven by
              harmonicity perception. Here we question this view,
              substantiating our argument by critically reviewing historic
              consonance research from a broad variety of disciplines,
              reanalyzing consonance perception data from 4 previous behavioral
              studies representing more than 500 participants, and modeling
              three Western musical corpora representing more than 100,000
              compositions. We conclude that simultaneous consonance is a
              composite phenomenon that derives in large part from three
              phenomena: interference, periodicity/harmonicity, and cultural
              familiarity. We formalize this conclusion with a computational
              model that predicts a musical chord's simultaneous consonance
              from these three features, and release this model in an
              open-source R package, incon, alongside 15 other computational
              models also evaluated in this paper. We hope that this package
              will facilitate further psychological and musicological research
              into simultaneous consonance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020

              using an extremely brief measure of the Big-Five personality
              dimensions or using no measure at all. To meet the need for a
              very brief measure, 5 and 10-item inventories were developed and
              evaluated. Although somewhat inferior to standard multi-item
              instruments, the instruments reached adequate levels in terms of:
              (a) convergence with widely used Big-Five measures in self,
              observer, and peer reports, (b) test-retest reliability, (c)
              patterns of predicted external correlates, and (d) convergence
              between self and observer ratings. On the basis of these tests, a
              10-item measure of the Big-Five dimensions is offered for
              situations where very short measures are needed, personality is
              not the primary topic of interest, or researchers can tolerate
              the somewhat diminished psychometric properties associated with
